# Strapi Deployment on AWS using Terraform

This project demonstrates how I used **Terraform** to provision an **AWS EC2 instance**, generate an SSH key automatically, and deploy **Strapi (headless CMS)** on the server.  
The main goal of this task was to follow proper **DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code practices** using Terraform modules.

---

## Why this project?

Instead of creating infrastructure manually from the AWS console, everything here is:
- Automated
- Version-controlled
- Modular and reusable

This makes the setup reliable and easy to reproduce.

## Project Structure

terraform-strapi/
├── main.tf
├── provider.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── modules/
│ ├── ec2/
│ ├── keypair/
│ └── security-group/
└── .gitignore


**What each module does:**
- **ec2** → creates the EC2 instance
- **keypair** → generates the SSH key using Terraform
- **security-group** → allows SSH (22) and Strapi access (1337)

---

## What this setup does

- Creates an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform
- Generates a `.pem` key through Terraform itself
- Configures security groups for required ports
- Outputs the EC2 public IP for easy access
- Keeps sensitive files out of Git using `.gitignore`

---

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:
- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured with valid credentials
- Git installed
- An AWS account

---

## How to run this project

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/piyushhsharma/strapi-terraform.git
cd strapi-terraform/terraform-strapi
2. Initialize Terraform
terraform init
3. Apply Terraform configuration
terraform apply
When prompted, provide a valid AMI ID (for example, Ubuntu 22.04 for your region).

Terraform will provision the infrastructure and show the public IP address of the EC2 instance.

Connect to the EC2 instance
ssh -i strapi.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
Replace <EC2_PUBLIC_IP> with the IP shown in Terraform output.

Installing and running Strapi on EC2
After connecting to the instance:

sudo apt update
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g yarn
npx create-strapi-app my-strapi-app --quickstart
Strapi will start automatically and can be accessed at:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:1337
Security & best practices followed
.terraform/, .tfstate, and .pem files are not committed

Infrastructure code is modular and reusable

SSH key is generated by Terraform (not manually created)

Clear separation between infrastructure and application code

Notes
This project was created as part of a DevOps task to demonstrate:

Terraform fundamentals

Module usage

AWS EC2 provisioning

Secure handling of sensitive files

### ✅ Why this version is better
- Sounds **natural and honest**
- Explains *why* decisions were made
- Perfect for **internship / evaluation**
- Easy for reviewers to understand quickly

If you want, I can:
- Shorten it (very crisp version)
- Make it more **interview-oriented**
- Add a **“What I learned”** section (big plus for interns)

Just tell me 👌
